# Investigating a dataset-No Show Appointments

<b>INTRODUCTION:</b><br><br>
This dataset collects information from 100k medical appointments in Brazil and is focused on the question of whether or not patients show up for their appointment. A number of characteristics about the patient are included in each row.<br>
● ‘ScheduledDay’ tells us on what day the patient set up their appointment.<br>
● ‘Neighborhood’ indicates the location of the hospital.<br>
● ‘Scholarship’ indicates whether or not the patient is enrolled in Brasilian welfare program Bolsa Família.<br>
● ‘No_show’ it says ‘No’ if the patient showed up to their appointment, and ‘Yes’ if they did not show up.<br><br>
